 Application web "Rick and Morty Randomizer"

////////// Rick and Morty Character Card Generator //////////

1. The Rick and Morty Character Cards application is a user interface for displaying and exploring information about characters from the animated series Rick and Morty. It utilizes the public Rick and Morty API to fetch character data and display their corresponding cards on the web page.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

2. Random Selection of 12 Characters

New 12 Characters: This feature allows the user to randomly select 12 new characters to display.

12 Deceased Characters: Randomly selects 12 deceased characters to display.

12 Living Characters: Randomly selects 12 living characters to display.

12 Characters with "Unknown" Status: Randomly selects 12 characters with an "Unknown" status to display.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

3. Interaction with Cards

The cards are deployed on hover in desktop version and automatically on scroll in mobile version.

Modal Opening: Clicking on
a character card opens a 
modal to display detailed 
information about the 
character, including image, 
origin, location, and episode list.

Modal Closing: The modal
can be closed by clicking the
close button or clicking outside
the modal.

To use the application, simply load the page. The first 12 character cards will be displayed. Then, the user can interact with the buttons to select different sets of characters or scroll the page to display more cards.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

4. Responsive Design and Animations

On mobile version, to enhance user experience, character cards respond to page scrolling. When a card partially enters the view, this activates and displays more content until it moves off the screen

The switch buttons activate a halo animation when clicked, improving visual feedback for the user.

5. Round of tests for features

A check that each button is working correctly by clicking on each of them 6 times and checking card by card if there are duplicates and if the draw is indeed random.

Conclusive test, no duplicates detected on any of the iterations and those on the four buttons

Second set of tests to verify with two clicks on each status button that the statuses of the selected characters conform to the expected one.

Conclusive test because the statutes are compliant.
